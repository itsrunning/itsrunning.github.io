</h3>

<p><em><strong>effective:</strong></em> We all get to work in different projects with different tech stacks. Over time, as a community we would have worked in multiple automation frameworks each of which is unique in terms of the elements/tools used. A collection of all these automation frameworks in their bare-bones, shared as one repository can be quite useful for anyone exploring options to build an automation framework.</p>

<p><em><strong>simple:</strong></em> It is as simple as spending couple of hours (or perhaps little more) to write a bare-bones version of our project automation framework.</p>

<p><em><strong>executable:</strong></em> The sample framework, even in its bare-bones, should include at-the-least one sample automation test, which is, </p> 
<ul> 
<li> executable locally by following the Readme instructions captured in the repo </li>
<li> actively running in a cloud-ci, radiating the build status </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the joy-of-sharing, in the process of doing this one can get,</p>

<ul>
<li>a more detailed understanding of their own project framework if he/she didn't get to be part of the initial setup days</li>
<li>to learn what is Travis, how to configure this cloud based CI to execute the sample tests included in the repo for every check-in and how to radiate the current build status as part of the Readme page</li>
<li>to learn lot more including how to write a github Readme page, managing pull-requests from interested contributors, etc.,</li>
</ul>

<p>This idea was conceived by <em>Deepak Paramasivam</em> and with the effort of our <em>ThoughtWorks Chennai QA community</em> the idea materialised. Currently, it has sample frameworks across web-automation, mobile-automation, performance testing, etc., </p>

<p>Although this initiative took shape within ThoughtWorks premises, this code-base is open to anyone and everyone reading this. You are welcome to check-out/download and more importantly join hands in authoring pull-requests (enriching the existing frameworks) and creating new frameworks (from scratch). </p>

<p><em>The intent is to grow this active collection of repos, with new sample repos getting added as part of every project we get to work on. </em></p>

<p>Well, if you are excited about this idea and would like to author a repo, let us know your interest by <a href="https://github.com/itsrunning/itsrunning.github.io/issues/new">creating a issue here.</a></p>
