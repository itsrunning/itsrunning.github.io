Over time, as a community we would have worked in multiple automation frameworks each of which is unique in terms of the elements/tools used. A collection of all these automation frameworks in their bare-bones, shared as one repository can be quite useful for anyone exploring options to build an automation framework.\r\n\r\n_**simple:**_ It is as simple as spending couple of hours (or perhaps little more) to write a bare-bones version of our project automation framework to include a sample automation test which is executable by following the Readme instructions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, in the process of doing this one can get,\r\n+ a more detailed understanding of their own project framework if he/she didn't get to be part of the initial setup days\r\n+ to learn what is Travis, how to configure this cloud based CI to execute the sample tests included in the repo for every check-in and how to radiate the current build status as part of the Readme page\r\n+ to learn lot more including how to write a github Readme page, managing pull-requests from interested contributors after the framework is checked-in, etc.,\r\n\r\nThis is the idea conceived by Deepak Paramasivam and with the effort of our ThoughtWorks Chennai QA community the idea materialised. Though this initiative took shape within ThoughtWorks premises, this repo is open to anyone and everyone reading this. You are welcome to check-out/download and more importantly join hands in authoring pull-requests (enriching the existing frameworks) and creating new frameworks (from scratch). \r\n\r\nCurrently, it has sample frameworks across web-automation, mobile-automation, performance, etc., The vision is to keep this an active collection of repos, with new sample repos getting added as part of every project we get to work on. \r\n\r\n[Proceed here](https://github.com/itsrunning) to checkout the repository.\r\n",
